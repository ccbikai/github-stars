## TODOs

- [ ] Docs:
  - [ ] terrarium split & overlays
  - [ ] changes to upstream tile builds:
    - [ ] openmaptiles: Added more languages
    - [ ] protomaps: reduced zoom level to 14 (but included all features on that zoom), add more languages
    - [ ] shortbread: Added more langauges, added some poi types (harbor?)?
      - [ ] Add the tags from <https://github.com/shortbread-tiles/shortbread-tilemaker/blob/a92a462bc83dc7dc4910c90da4c236fee23b1b27/process.lua#L937>, that seems to be more up to date
      - [ ] Fix boundary labels being empty
- [ ] Styles
  - [ ] Add <https://gitlab.com/trailstash/openstyle> with the additional data as a separate vector source
  - [ ] Add ferry_terminal icons to at least shortbread, add at least harbor to shortbread spec and versatiles <https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-style/blob/main/icons/transport/harbor.svg>
- [ ] Fonts
  - [ ] Handle fonts with duplicate names when <https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/8776> is answered
- [ ] NE vector
  - [ ] Cleanup scripts
  - [ ] Move into a planetiler build instead of hacky bash scripts
  - [ ] use ne_10m_roads_north_america
  - [ ] use ne_10m_railroads_north_america
- [ ] mbtiles client option (started in client/mbtiles.js)
- [ ] Perf comparison between different serving modes and servers
- [ ] Add <https://github.com/wipfli/foursquare-os-places-pmtiles> as a POI dataset
- [ ] Reverse geocoding (by parsing exisiting vector tiles, started in TMP-remove-experimentreverse-geocode-via-tiles.js)
- [ ] Better attribution free maps by adding more wikidata
- [ ] Landcover tiles
- [ ] Mapzen tiles & styles (compare with protomaps)
- [ ] Geocoding
- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Add maplibre-geoman-free with realtime capabilities (via webrtc datachannels)
- [ ] Add CSP guidance
- [ ] Create torrents for all the large datasets

- <https://github.com/shortbread-tiles/shortbread-docs>
  - No admin levels past 4 (6 for counties)

  - pois/sites harbour=yes
  - sites leisure=park
  - sites leisure=nature_reserve
  - sites boundary=national_park
- <https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps>
  - No maritime boundaries?
  - pois harbour
  - no places kind=county, but there is boundaries kind=county
  - places capital=yesÂ¡2|4|6? Why mix string and bool
  - Reason for including both earth and ocean

## Build full dataset from scratch

WARNING: This will use about 5TB and take 14-20 days

Running the whole build from scratch requires a somewhat beefy machine (64-128GB RM, good CPU) and around 14-20 days.

To run use `./build.sh build_image` to build an image with all the tools to build the files. Prep to run with `mkdir -p /usr/local/0-9se/sites/maps.black/` and run the image with `portablectl attach --profile trusted --enable --now --no-block ./maps.black.raw`. You can view progress with `journalctl -fu maps.black-*`.

These steps do not build terrarium/s2maps since they are merely a packaged version of what is available from their upstreams. If you want to package them yourself I'm guessing you know how to download with curl and package into mbtils/pmtiles from the examples in the repo.
