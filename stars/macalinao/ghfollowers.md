===============

[GitHub Followers][site] is a service to get and receive GitHub followers. It uses your OAuth2 token from GitHub's API to follow other users registered with our website. In return, we use those tokens to have them follow you back.

### Is this safe/allowed?
**Absolutely.** The GitHub terms of service only state that you are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. Because all we ask for are the `user:follow` and `public_repo` (for starring our repo) permissions, we can't do anything malicious with your account. In fact, the source code to this website is available here!

### What happens if I unfollow people/revoke my token?
We'll permanently lower your cap. This app depends on having legitimate, non-botted people following each other, so breaking the trust destroys our service. We'll lower your follower cap to compensate for the unfollowed user.

## Setup

To setup the dev environment, run the following commands:

```
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install
```

Then run:


```
$ gulp watch
```
