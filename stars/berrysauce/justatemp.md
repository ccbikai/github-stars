### What is justatemp.com?
justatemp.com is a yet another, free to use, open source, and of course, privacy-friendly, temporary email generator. You can use justatemp.com to receive emails from sites you don't really want to give your email to. All received emails are publicly stored for 2 hours and then permanently deleted.

### What about privacy?
justatemp.com only stores the received emails. No other user data is stored. The emails are automatically deleted after 2 hours. Until then, everyone with the receiving address can view the emails this address received. For analytics, justatemp.com uses Cloudflare's anonymous web analytics.

### What are collector, postmaster, and postoffice?
- 📮 `mailbox` is a Cloudflare email worker which receives and stores all incoming mails
- 🚚 `postservice` is the email distributor in the form of an API powered by a HonoJS Cloudflare worker
- 🏤 `frontend` is the SvelteKit frontend which displays the received emails to the user

### How does justatemp.com work?
Incoming mails go to the `mailbox` email worker. It saves the email in a Cloudflare KV database. The Svelte frontend generates a random email address and requests all emails for this address from the `postservice`. If emails are available, it displays them, sorted by the UNIX timestamp included in the KV entry.

### Development
More on that soon
