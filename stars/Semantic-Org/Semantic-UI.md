[![CDNJS](https://img.shields.io/cdnjs/v/semantic-ui.svg)](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/semantic-ui/)

[Semantic](http://www.semantic-ui.com) is a UI framework designed for theming.

Key Features
* 50+ UI elements
* 3000 + CSS variables
* 3 Levels of variable inheritance (similar to SublimeText)
* Built with EM values for responsive design
* Flexbox friendly

Semantic allows developers to build beautiful websites fast, with **concise HTML**, **intuitive javascript**, and **simplified debugging**, helping make front-end development a delightful experience. Semantic is responsively designed allowing your website to scale on multiple devices. Semantic is production ready and partnered with frameworks such as **React**, **Angular**, **Meteor**, and **Ember**, which means you can integrate it with any of these frameworks to organize your UI layer alongside your application logic.

## 2.5.0 Release (Oct 6, 2022)

Semantic UI is now compatible with Node 18 and Gulp 4.
