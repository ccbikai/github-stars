## 🧪 Note

ForgeUI isn’t a community-driven project — it's more like a personal lab where I explore UI, animation, and motion design in React.  
Everything you see is built with the intent to learn, refine, and share what excites me in the frontend space.  
You're welcome to explore and take inspiration — but this repo isn’t actively maintained for external contributions.
