## ⚠️WARNING: ZeroSSL removed the `Delete Certificate` API endpoint, free account can't renew certificate infinitely.

zerossl-ip-cert is a automation tool for issuing ZeroSSL IP certificates.

* Use ZeroSSL [REST API](https://zerossl.com/documentation/api/)  to implement certificate issuing.
* Mainly made for **IP** certificates (ipv4 only for now).
* Call external program for automatically verification.
* Painless certificate renewal.
* Cross platform (Linux/Macos/Windows).

## Installation

* Package zerossl-ip-cert contains ZeroSSL [REST API](https://zerossl.com/documentation/api/) client, one can
  just `go get github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert` and import it to use the client.
* To build static executables, clone this repository and `make release` , or you can make your desire target binary, just take a look at the [Makefile](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/Makefile).

## Usage

zerossl-ip-cert rely on configuration file to run. To archive the goal of issuing certificate automatically, you need do some additional work, saying the external hook.

### Usage Info

```
Usage: zerossl-ip-cert [ -renew ] -config CONFIG_FILE

  -config string
        Config file
  -renew
        Renew existing certs only
```

### Configuration File

You can find a sample configuration file [here](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/exec/sample-config.yaml), with enough comments in it.

 And also a sample  state record file [here](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/exec/sample-current.yaml), just for troubleshooting.

### External Hook

zerossl-ip-cert use `HTTP_CSR_HASH` validation method to verify domains (including ip address surely), get more information from the ZeroSSL official [documentation](https://zerossl.com/documentation/api/verify-domains/).

So you should have a http server running and prepare hook programs to finish the domain verification.

* **verify-hook** will be called before domain verification, some environment variables will be passed to it.

  `ZEROSSL_HTTP_FV_HOST` stands for listening host, here will be ip address.

  `ZEROSSL_HTTP_FV_PATH` stands for url path, where verification content will locate.

  `ZEROSSL_HTTP_FV_PORT` stands for listening port, ZeroSSL only reach port `80` of your http server according to use experience.

  `ZEROSSL_HTTP_FV_CONTENT` stands for validation content, ZeroSSL will check it when domain verification started.

  And a sample script for nginx can be found [here](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/exec/sample-nginx-verify-hook.sh), a sample script for caddy can be found [here](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/exec/sample-caddy-verify-hook.cmd).

  *P.S.* When running in **Windows OS**, text lines are concatenated with spaces in `%ZEROSSL_HTTP_FV_CONTENT%`, as windows doesn't accept multiline variables without using magic.

* **post-hook** will be called after certification downloading, and some other environment variables will be passed to it.

  `ZEROSSL_CERT_FPATH` stands for the store path of certificate.

  `ZEROSSL_KEY_FPATH` stands for the store path of private key.

  And a sample script for nginx can be found [here](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/exec/sample-nginx-post-hook.sh), a sample script for caddy can be found [here](https://github.com/tinkernels/zerossl-ip-cert/blob/master/exec/sample-caddy-post-hook.cmd).
